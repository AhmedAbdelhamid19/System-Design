# 4 - Fault Tolerance, Availability, Redundancy, and SPOF, latency

## Fault Tolerance

- The system continues to work even if some machines fail.

## Single Point of Failure (SPOF)

- Any component whose failure will bring down the entire system.

## Redundancy

- Duplicate components (servers, networks, power supplies) so another can take over on failure.

## Availability

- The system can serve users most of the time; measured as uptime (e.g., 99%, 99.99%).

## Reliability

- Ability to run correctly over time while tolerating failures without data loss or incorrect behavior.

## Latency
- Delay to response
