# 1 - Introduction to Distributed Systems

## What is a distributed system?

- Many machines working together as if they are a single system.
- Multiple computers (servers) connected over a network, cooperating to behave like one powerful system.

## Why use distributed systems?

- To handle massive concurrent users, one server cannot handle millions of requests per second.
- To store and process very large volumes of data (petabytes).
- To increase reliability: a single failed server does not bring the whole system down.
- To reduce latency for global users by placing services closer to them.
