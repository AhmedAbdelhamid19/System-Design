	- what's the difference between relational DB and NoSQL DB?
		○ relational DB focuses on correctness and structure first, NoSQL focuses on scaling and flexibility.
		○ sometimes hybrid system used, so some features deal with NoSQL, other deal with relational DB.
		○ relational
			§ correctness, transactions (ACID), integrity.
			§ data split into many tables connected by relationships, this avoid duplication but requires joins (joins become expensive at scale).
			§ add new columns requires migration, change schema (modern relational databases support online schema changes without full table locks), lock table, and risk in production.
			§ you get right data, no contradictions.
			§ you can make column of type JSON and store nested data (but don't powerful like NoSQL database)
		○ NoSQL (not only sql)
			§ scalability, horizontal scale, flexibility (schemaless). 
			§ data which stored together, used together, you build it based on 'how will i access this data'.
			§ data is stored as document structures similar to JSON, using internal binary formats optimized for storage and access.
			§ you don't need to make joins (you can store nested data), support fast read, but cost duplication.
			§ instead of storing data in seperated tables, we store it as nested data (store devices information inside user collection).
      § should have implicit schema to reduce work and overhead you make, means avoiding random keys and random nested data …etc. to ease it to you when you work with backend (deserialization).
	- why NoSQL scalable / what's more scalable NoSQL or relational DB?
		○ NoSQL systems are generally easier to scale horizontally than traditional relational databases.
		○ NoSQL is designed to scale horizontally by default, relational DB is designed to be correct by default.
		○ NoSQL avoid joins, because it by default store related data together, one request hits one server, it avoid overhead specially with joins with sharded data.
	- what's more high available NoSQL or relational DB?
		○ NoSQL prioritizes availability, relation DB support strong consistency (remember CAP theorem)
		○ NoSQL is spread to different servers (what supposed to be), and many nodes active at the same time, if one node dies other continue serving.
	- what problems may appears with duplication with NoSQL databases?
		○ the core problem is keeping duplicated data consistent (up-to-date).
		○ for example if 'price' stored in product document and order document …., and 'price' is updated, the challenge is how to update the price in all instances in all documents.
		○ updates are often propagated asynchronously, which commonly results in eventual consistency where users may temporarily read stale data.
		○ there're a lot of ways to update the data: 
			§ background propagation (send event to workers to updated related parts), immutable data (old data never update), read repair (on read detect stale data) …etc.
	- what's Redis, what problem Redis solves?
		○ database access is slow compared to memory, some data is read and written very frequently
		○ Redis keep data in RAM, so queries become very fast (micro seconds), it's in memory key value data store
		○ it used to cache 
			§ database queries
			§ user sessions (if user made request, it check session in redis, if exist then user authenticated)
			§ API rate limit (if user made 100 request, the counter stored in redis) …etc.
		○ Redis is not main database, because RAM is expensive, and data can be lost if not persisted.
	- what's elastic search, what problem it solve?
		○ relational databases can search text using indexes, but they are not optimized for large scale full text search, relevance ranking, and complex text queries, which leads to poor performance at scale.
		○ Elasticsearch stores its own copy of data, but it is usually not the source of truth; the primary data lives in another database.
	- what's Client side IndexedDB, what problem it solves?
		○ IndexedDB is used to store large amounts of structured data on the client side, enabling offline support, faster access, and reduced network requests.
		○ it's browser built in data base, persistent, asynchronous, used for offline support, caching API responses …etc.
		○ limited to browsers only, and user can clear it, and not shared across devices.
	- list some types of NoSQL database.
		○ key value
			§ key is unique identifier, and value is blob of data.
				□ key here like PK in relation database, that from it you ger the row, but here from key you get the value of that document
			§ basic operations: get(key), set(key, value), delete(key)
			§ hash function used to get the location of the data in time near to O(1), it's Extremely fast for lookups by key.
			§ Value can be anything (string, JSON, binary), but the database cannot query inside it (unless the engine has special features).
			§ the value is opaque to the database (database does not understand the structure).
			§ Redis, DynamoDB are popular key value databases 
		○ document
			§ A database that stores data as documents, usually in JSON-like format (MongoDB uses BSON, which is binary JSON), Different documents in the same collection can have different fields.
			§ Each document is a self-contained unit of data. It can have nested objects, arrays, and varying fields.
			§ Can query by indexed fields, including nested keys, and supports secondary indexes and complex queries.
			§ Examples: MongoDB
		○ wide column
		○ graph
	- NoSQL Replication & Consistency (R, W, RF)
		○ RF (Replication Factor): Number of nodes holding a copy of the data.
		○ W (Write quorum): Minimum nodes that must acknowledge a write.
		○ R (Read quorum): Minimum nodes that must respond to a read.   
		○ for example if you have 5 DB all for read and write, then if you made write to 3 DB and read from 3 DB then you guarantee to take latest data in read query (with read, check overhead).
		○ it's another solution other than write to all node and read from 1 node, here we make R + W > RF, so we write to less node and read from more node and make another overhead to take latest data.
		○ you can make it strong consistency if R + W > RF, or not strong consistency if R + W <= RF (some time you may accept stale data, another you are lucky and get most recent data)
