- what's the difference between load balancer and geo routing and DNS.
  ○ they operate at different layers and different decisions.
  ○ load balancer:
    - mainly decides which server handles the request
  ○ geo routing 
    - geo routing decides which region or endpoint IP the user should be sent to
  ○ DNS is like the internet’s phone book. Every website has an IP address
    - we are humans, and we remember names so DNS translates the human-friendly name into the computer-friendly IP address.
    - so when you type the url, then computer send to DNS server and replies with IP.
    - your browser connects to that Ip and loads the website.
    - DNS with geo routing enabled returns an IP address that already points to the chosen region.
	- same data center:
		○ All servers are in one physical building.
		○ prefered to be used when app is smaller or medium and users are mostly local, and  the cost may be low
		○ scaling works by adding a load balancer and more application servers in the same data center.
		○ network latency between servers is extremely low and usually negligible, user facing latency still depends on how far the user is from the data center.
		○ pros: very low network delay, simple architecture, easy database consistency.
		○ cons: the data center is a single point of failure, if the data center fails everything will goes down, user far away still get latency.
	- same region:
		○ you pick a region that is geographically closer to the majority of your users, for example in AWS you have 'us-east', 'us-west'  …etc.
		○ you can pick a region that are closer to your user application, deploy to multiple datacenter in same region.
		○ you are protected from single data center failures (SPOF), region wide failures are still possible but much rarer.
	- different region:
		○ you can deploy to different regions for example near to your users in middle east and to you users in Europe, USA …etc.
		○  gives you higher availability, This is true global scale.
		○ lower user latency for nearby users, higher availability and scalability, additional complexity due to data replication and legal requirements based on region you deploy on:
			- GDPR in EU, HIPAA … in USA
			- for example in EU, Explicit user consent required for cookies, tracking, data processing …etc., Often requires data to be stored in-region or at least comply with GDPR when transferring outside EU
			- the fines with this laws are very high, if you deployed to region and you broke the rules.
      	○ you should not rely on a single global primary database for all regions.
