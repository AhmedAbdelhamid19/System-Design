- what's the difference between load balancer and geo routing and DNS.
  ○ they operate at different layers and different decisions.
  ○ load balancer:
    - mainly decides which server handles the request
  ○ geo routing 
    - geo routing decides which region or endpoint IP the user should be sent to
  ○ DNS is like the internet’s phone book. Every website has an IP address
    - we are humans, and we remember names so DNS translates the human-friendly name into the computer-friendly IP address.
    - so when you type the url, then computer send to DNS server and replies with IP.
    - your browser connects to that Ip and loads the website.
    - DNS with geo routing enabled returns an IP address that already points to the chosen region.
