	- A distributed system is:
		○ many machines working together as if they are one system.
		○ Multiple computers (servers) connected over a network, working together to behave like one powerful system.
	- why do we even need distributed systems?
		○ too many users, Millions open the app at the same moment. One server cannot handle millions of requests per second.
		○ Too much data (petabytes of data)
		○ Need for high reliability, If your only server dies, your whole business dies. Companies need systems that continue working even when hardware fails.
		○ Need for fast global access, A user in Egypt, another in Germany, another in the USA. One server cannot give all of them low-latency responses.
