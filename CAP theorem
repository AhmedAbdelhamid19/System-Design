- core problem
  ○ When your system runs on more than one machine, failures and network delays are guaranteed
  ○ you cannot assume all machines see the same data, you cannot assume that the network is always reliable
  ○ CAP theorem explains the limits of distributed systems under these conditions.
- when a network partition happen you must choose consistency or availability, you cannot keep both.
  ○ Partition tolerance is not optional in real systems, it's mandatory
- Consistency (strong consistency)
  ○ means every successful read returns the most recent successful write
- Availability
  ○ Every request receives a response, without the guarantee that it contains the most recent write.
  ○ The system remains operational even if some nodes are down, The system does not refuse requests due to coordination or consistency checks.
- partition tolerance
  ○ means, the system continues to work even when the network breaks between machines.
  ○ like network link failure, or timeout between servers.
- CP
  ○ Consistency and Partition tolerance
  ○ If a network partition occurs, the system will sacrifice Availability to maintain data integrity.
  ○ The system may reject requests or time out if it cannot guarantee that it is returning the most recent write. Users may see errors (e.g., "Service Unavailable"), but they will never receive "stale" or incorrect data.
- AP
  ○ Availability and Partition tolerance
  ○ If a network partition occurs, the system will sacrifice strict Consistency to remain operational, Data may be stale temporarily (eventual consistency), but data syncs later, so Every request received by a non-failing node must result in a successful (non-error) response.
  ○ used with systems like social network, features like 'comments' 'likes' …etc.
- CA 
  ○ systems do not exist in real distributed systems.
