- core problem
  ○ When your system runs on more than one machine, failures and network delays are guaranteed
  ○ you cannot assume all machines see the same data, you cannot assume that the network is always reliable
  ○ CAP theorem explains the limits of distributed systems under these conditions.
- when a network partition happen you must choose consistency or availability, you cannot keep both.
  ○ Partition tolerance is not optional in real systems, it's mandatory
- Consistency (strong consistency)
  ○ means every successful read returns the most recent successful write
- Availability
  ○ Every request receives a response, without the guarantee that it contains the most recent write.
  ○ The system remains operational even if some nodes are down, The system does not refuse requests due to coordination or consistency checks.
- partition tolerance
  ○ means, the system continues to work even when the network breaks between machines.
  ○ like network link failure, or timeout between servers.
