- core problem
  ○ When your system runs on more than one machine, failures and network delays are guaranteed
  ○ you cannot assume all machines see the same data, you cannot assume that the network is always reliable
  ○ CAP theorem explains the limits of distributed systems under these conditions.
- when a network partition happen you must choose consistency or availability, you cannot keep both.
  ○ Partition tolerance is not optional in real systems, it's mandatory
